# SignAge – Inclusive Sign Language Learning Platform

SignAge is an AI-powered learning platform designed to **teach sign language in a simple, engaging way** and **bridge the communication gap between special children and normal children**.
The platform combines **computer vision, AI gesture recognition, web technologies, and optional hardware feedback** to create an inclusive learning environment.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

There is a lack of accessible tools that help special children learn and communicate using sign language, making everyday interaction difficult for them and for other kids around them.

We need an application that:

* Teaches sign language in a **simple, interactive, and engaging way**
* Helps **normal children understand signs** used by special children
* Improves communication
* Reduces social barriers
* Promotes **inclusive learning for all kids**

---

## 💡 Ideation & Research (AI-Assisted)

We conducted ideation and research using AI tools to:

* Identify learning challenges faced by special children
* Explore existing sign-language learning solutions
* Evaluate AI models suitable for real-time gesture recognition
* Decide on hardware feedback mechanisms for tactile learning
